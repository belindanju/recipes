We are lucky to have mints in our backyard.</li> <li>Ice! It is not easy to crush or shave ices. I saw people using knife for this step (but I did not dare to try), but if you have a blender, just pop in a few ice cubes and you should be all set.</li> <li>A nice cocktail glass. We also tried the copper mug we used for Moscow Mule, but the copper mug is a bit too large for us to \"pack it with ice\".</li> <li>Dash some bitter to complement the flavor. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"cocktails/mint_julep/#my-ratings","title":"My Ratings","text":"<p>This drink is easy to make but is not for me. It lacks the flavor depth I like, in particular the richness in acidity and sweetness.</p>"},{"location":"drinks/mango_smoothie/","title":"Mango Smoothie","text":"<p>It is super easy to make if you have the right tool.  A reasonable portion just needs 1 mango (from Whole Foods), 1 to 1.5 cups of milk depending on the consistency you like, some plain greek yogurt or some honey depending on the flavor balance you prefer. Blend everything with a few normal-sized ice cubes. </p> <p>\ud83d\udcb0 estimated to be around 3 dollars. Not cheap but cheaper than store-bought?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"drinks/mango_smoothie/#flavor-profile","title":"Flavor Profile","text":"<p>A little tanginess from the mango and the natural sweetness from the milk. If you like mango or milk, you will probably like this drink. </p> <p>Unlike the store-bought smoothies, the sweetness of my smoothie is subtle and is probably around 20%-30% of store-bought. </p>"},{"location":"drinks/mango_smoothie/#what-matters","title":"What Matters?","text":"<ol> <li>The ability to cut the mango nicely and quickly. I used to first peel the mango, then slice the mango. But this method takes too much time. Often, when I want Mango smoothie, I want it either for breakfast or after work out---I don't want to wait five minutes to be able to drink it. Who has that time? So after some digging and experimenting, summer mangos at Whole Foods seem to be of high quality, smaller cores that I can just directly slice the mango in two big chunks, and then cube it. </li> <li>Being able to adjust the acidity and sweetness based on the mango's profile. Now (I think) mango is in season in June MA and I can always get mangos with rich flavor easily. Depending on how the mango tastes, I will add some honey if the mango is on the acidity side and I will add some plain greek yogurt if the mango is too sweet. </li> <li>Ice! I find the key to make this delicious drink is to make it super cold. The easiest way is to add (cold) milk and ice cubes and blend with the rest ingredient. The drink consistency sometimes comes out running and the mango flavor damper. I tried to freeze mango cubes and use them to replace the ice cubes---unfortunately this does not work for me. There are two key issues. Unless you have the patient to freeze the mango cubes spread out in a baking sheet or something, you will end up with a big chunk of iced mango; which my blender has so much trouble to blend. I don't blame it. The second issue is now I have to add a lot of milk to reach the consistency I like. The smoothies should be flow nicely from the blender to the cup. This might sound like a non-issue because I love milk but, it is a practical problem because of the \"milk resource contention\"---the milk resource is carefully provisioned at our household (because the brand we like has increased the price by 50% over the past couple of years) and is prioritized for making lattes. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"meat/black_pepper_beef_stir_fry/","title":"Black Pepper Beef Stir","text":"<p>This is one of my favorite dishes. It is very easy to make and works really well with most cut of beef.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"meat/black_pepper_beef_stir_fry/#flavor-profile","title":"Flavor Profile","text":"<p>The most prominent flavor is black pepper in this dish. This is a mimic of the classic hot iron black pepper beef (\u94c1\u677f\u9ed1\u6912\u725b\u67f3). If you love the earthy smell and flavor of black pepper, this dish might be the one for you too! </p> <p>This dish has the nice aroma from the veggies, and the slight sweetness from the sauce. I usually do not like sweet and savory dishes, but there is just something about this dish that captures my taste buds. </p> <p>This is a nice all-year-around dish because the veggies that work well with this dish are super accessible all year around! </p>"},{"location":"meat/black_pepper_beef_stir_fry/#what-matters","title":"What Matters?","text":"<ol> <li>The beef needs to be properly tenderized. I find that the easiest way is to spend $$$ to get a nice cut, chunk roast works surprisingly well. Sometimes I will even use the short rib. How you cut the meat also matters. Tries to cut against the grain. I use a combination of salt, oil, soy sauce, starch, and baking soda to marinate the meat for at least an hour---if you can do it overnight, then the beef will be both flavorful and tender.</li> <li>Onions! I am not a huge fan of onions but I love onions with beef stir fry. You can try to cook without onions, but the dish will not taste as good. Onions also elevate the dish's smell too.</li> <li>Temperature. You need to be able to get your wok to a very high temperature, so high that the vegetable oil starts to smoke. This allows the meat to cook fast and stay tender. If you don't have a non-stick wok, this can be tricky. The marinated meat might stick to the bottom of the wok, and the brown bits also burn very quickly. There are an easy way to mitigate this issue. Use a lot of oil! Because the high temperature, you can't really work away from the wok when you are cooking. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"meat/smash_burger/","title":"Smash Burger","text":"<p>A post-workout guilty pleasure. </p> <p>I first had the smash burger in the Philly airport and it was amazing!  It was a chicken smash burger with avocado and oh my, avocado makes everything tastes great. </p> <p>I love it so much that we have to recreate the recipe. Our smash burger uses the double beef patties (there is just no other way to make burger) and American cheese.  The other key ingredient is jalape\u00f1o (learnt from Five guys). If you can't take heat, you need to take out the seeds and then grill it.  </p> <p>If you want to go with a healthy version, replace the buns with lettuce wraps (yes that in-and-out burger trick). I had to try the lettuce wraps once but I have to admit, it just does not hit the spot.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"meat/smash_burger/#flavor-profile","title":"Flavor Profile","text":"<p>The most prominent flavor is the cheesy beef taste.

What we call \u5ba3\u5175\u593a\u4e3b in Chinese. So just regular decent buns please.</li> </ol>"}]}
